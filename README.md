# Bolt Earth React Native SDK (`@boltearth/react-native-sdk`)

This repo is a **library** plus an **`example/`** app.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `android/`, `ios/`, `src/` | Published npm package (native module + TS). |
| `example/` | Host React Native app (Hilt, data binding, LazyMapKey shims, dev client). |

Consumer apps add `"@boltearth/react-native-sdk"` to `package.json` and follow Android/iOS host setup (Gradle repos, Hilt, `dataBinding`, `BoltEarthUiSdkCore` pod, etc.).

### Develop locally

**Android:** symlinked `file:..` fails resource merging on some AGP versions. The example depends on a **packed tarball** at repo root:

```sh
npm pack   # writes `boltearth-react-native-sdk-1.0.0.tgz`
cd example && npm install && npm run android
```

Metro is configured so **JavaScript** loads from the repo root (`extraNodeModules`); change **Kotlin/Swift** → run `npm pack` again and `npm install` inside `example/`.

---

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) **example** project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Run all **example** commands from the `example/` directory after `npm install`.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
